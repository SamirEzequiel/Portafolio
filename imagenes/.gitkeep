I'll create a `.gitkeep` file for the images directory. This is a common convention to ensure that Git tracks empty directories, as Git normally doesn't track directories that don't contain any files.

The `.gitkeep` file is actually an empty file - it doesn't need any content. Its sole purpose is to ensure the `images` directory is included in version control.

Since `.gitkeep` is just an empty file, there's no actual content to generate. If you want to add this file to your repository, you can simply create an empty file named `.gitkeep` in your images directory.

Would you like me to provide any additional information about how to use the images directory in your portfolio project?
