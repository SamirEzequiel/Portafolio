I'll create a `.gitkeep` file for the assets/fonts directory. 

Just like the previous `.gitkeep` file, this is an empty file that serves as a placeholder to ensure Git tracks the otherwise empty `fonts` directory. Git doesn't track empty directories by default, so this is a common convention to maintain directory structure in version control.

The `.gitkeep` file doesn't need any content - it's simply an empty file with the name `.gitkeep`.

To add this file to your repository, you can create an empty file named `.gitkeep` in your assets/fonts directory.

Would you like me to provide any information about font management for your portfolio project or how to structure your assets directory?
