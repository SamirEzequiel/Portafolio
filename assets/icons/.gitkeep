I'll create a `.gitkeep` file for the assets/icons directory.

Like the previous `.gitkeep` files, this is an empty file that serves as a placeholder to ensure Git tracks the otherwise empty `icons` directory. Git doesn't track empty directories by default, so this convention allows you to maintain your directory structure in version control.

The `.gitkeep` file doesn't require any content - it's simply an empty file with the name `.gitkeep`.

To add this file to your repository, you can create an empty file named `.gitkeep` in your assets/icons directory.

Would you like me to provide any information about icon management for your portfolio project or suggestions for icon libraries you might want to use?
